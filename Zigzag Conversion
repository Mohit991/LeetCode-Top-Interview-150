# We will create an array of slots equal to numRows. We will keep each line of the zig zag
# in this array. Each slot will contain a list of chars.

# Now we will go through s and we will fill the array with the appropirate values. 
# when we go from top to bottom in the zig zag, we will put chars in the array.
# when we come back up, we will put chars in the arrays expect for last and first list.
# This is beacuse that is how the zig zag works.

# Once done we will take all the chars and add them to the result, row by row and return.
